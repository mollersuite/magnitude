# `MAGNITUDE`

We're [sherlocking](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Sherlock#English) Raycast.

Magnitude is a clean room reimplementation of Raycast built for the Linux desktop.

## `ETYMOLOGY`

When Roblox added [`BasePart.CanQuery`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart#CanQuery), [script builder](https://roblox.fandom.com/wiki/Script_builder) players switched from [`WorldRoot:Raycast`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/WorldRoot#Raycast) to [`Vector3.Magnitude`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/datatypes/Vector3#Magnitude) in their kill functions. We hope you'll switch from Raycast to Magnitude yourself.
